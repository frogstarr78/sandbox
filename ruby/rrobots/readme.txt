RRobots v0.2.2

First there was CRobots, followed by PRobots and many others, recently
(well also years ago) Robocode emerged and finally this is RRobots bringing
all the fun to the ruby community.

What is he talking about?

RRobots is a simulation environment for robots, these robots have a scanner
and a gun, can move forward and backwards and are entirely controlled by
ruby scripts. All robots are equal (well at the moment, maybe this will 
change) except for the ai.

A simple robot script may look like this:

----------------------- code -----------------------
require 'robot'

class NervousDuck
   include Robot

  def tick events
    turn_radar 1 if time == 0
    turn_gun 30 if time < 3
    accelerate 1
    turn 2
    fire 3 unless events['robot_scanned'].empty? 
  end
end
----------------------- code -----------------------

all you need to implement is the tick method which should accept a hash
of events occured turing the last tick.

By including Robot you get all this methods to controll your bot:

  battlefield_height  #the height of the battlefield
  battlefield_width   #the width of the battlefield
  energy              #your remaining energy (if this drops below 0 you are dead)
  gun_heading         #the heading of your gun, 0 pointing east, 90 pointing 
                      #north, 180 pointing west, 270 pointing south
  gun_heat            #your gun heat, if this is above 0 you can't shoot
  heading             #your robots heading, 0 pointing east, 90 pointing north,
                      #180 pointing west, 270 pointing south
  size                #your robots radius, if x <= size you hit the left wall
  radar_heading       #the heading of your radar, 0 pointing east, 
                      #90 pointing north, 180 pointing west, 270 pointing south
  time                #ticks since match start
  speed               #your speed (-8/8)
  x                   #your x coordinate, 0...battlefield_width
  y                   #your y coordinate, 0...battlefield_height
  accelerate(param)   #accelerate (max speed is 8, max accelerate is 1/-1, 
                      #negativ speed means moving backwards)
  stop                #accelerates negativ if moving forward (and vice versa), 
                      #may take 8 ticks to stop (and you have to call it every tick)
  fire(power)         #fires a bullet in the direction of your gun, 
                      #power is 0.1 - 3, this power will heat your gun
  turn(degrees)       #turns the robot (and the gun and the radar), 
                      #max 10 degrees per tick
  turn_gun(degrees)   #turns the gun (and the radar), max 30 degrees per tick
  turn_radar(degrees) #turns the radar, max 60 degrees per tick
  dead                #true if you are dead
  say(msg)            #shows msg above the robot on screen
  broadcast(msg)      #broadcasts msg to all bots (they recieve 'broadcasts'
                      #events with the msg and rough direction)

These methods are intentionally of very basic nature, you are free to
unleash the whole power of ruby to create higher level functions.
(e.g. move_to, fire_at and so on)

Some words of explanation: The gun is mounted on the body, if you turn
the body the gun will follow. In a simmilar way the radar is mounted on
the gun. The radar scans everything it sweeps over in a single tick (100 
degrees if you turn your body, gun and radar in the same direction) but
will report only the distance of scanned robots, not the angle. If you 
want more precission you have to turn your radar slower.

RRobots is implemented in pure ruby using a tk ui and should run on all
platforms that have ruby and tk. (until now it's tested on windows, OS X
and several linux distributions)

To start a match call:

ruby rrobots.rb [resolution] [#match] [-nogui] [-speed=<N>] [-timeout=<N>] 
      <FirstRobotClassName[.rb]> <SecondRobotClassName[.rb]> <...>
	  
  [resolution] (optional) should be of the form 640x480 or 800*600. 
    default is 800x800
  [match] (optional) to replay a match, put the match# here, including 
    the #sign.
  [-nogui] (optional) run the match without the gui, for highest possible 
    speed.(ignores speed value if present)
  [-speed=<N>] (optional, defaults to 1) updates GUI after every N ticks.  
    The higher the N, the faster the match will play.
  [-timeout=<N>] (optional, default 50000) number of ticks a match will 
    last at most.
    
  the names of the rb files have to match the class names of the robots
  (up to 8 robots)
  e.g. 'ruby rrobots.rb SittingDuck NervousDuck'
  or 'ruby rrobots.rb 600x600 #1234567890 SittingDuck NervousDuck'

If you want to run a tournament call:

ruby tournament.rb [-timeout=<N>] [-matches=<N>] 
      (-dir=<Directory> | <RobotClassName[.rb]>+)

  [-timeout=<N>] (optional, default 10000) number of ticks a match 
    will last at most.
  [-matches=<N>] (optional, default 2) how many times each robot 
    fights every other robot.
  -dir=<Directory> All .rb files from that directory will be 
    matched against each other.
    
  the names of the rb files have to match the class names of the robots.

Each robot is matched against each other 1on1. The results are available 
as yaml or html files.
